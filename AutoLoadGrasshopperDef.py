""" Opens a corresponding GH file (if existing) when opening a Rhino file.
    It is recommended to have this script in your Rhino startup command list:
    _-RunPythonScript AutoLoadGrasshopperDef.py

    Caveat! This script can't do anything when Rhino is not already open 
            and you double-click open a Rhino file.
            Also just works when opening .3dm files.

    which was originally not working, since the script gets started in the
    document context of the previous document, which not longer exists, when
    the user is opening a new Rhino file
    this is also the reason why we don't use
